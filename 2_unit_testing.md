## Unit testing of chef cookbooks

### What is unit testing
From [Art of Unit Testing](http://artofunittesting.com/definition-of-a-unit-test/):
>A good unit test is:
>* Able to be fully automated
>* Has full control over all the pieces running (Use mocks or stubs to achieve this isolation when needed)
>* Can be run in any order  if part of many other tests
>* Runs in memory (no DB or File access, for example)
>* Consistently returns the same result (You always run the same test, so no random numbers, for example. save those for integration or range tests)
>* Runs fast
>* Tests a single logical concept in the system
>* Readable
>* Maintainable
>* Trustworthy (when you see its result, you donâ€™t need to debug the code just to be sure)

From [Seth Vargo's blog](https://sethvargo.com/unit-testing-chef-cookbooks/):
>[...]
> We need to start thinking about messages, not results (in unit tests).
>In other words, your test is "Did I tell Chef to install the package?", not "Did Chef install the package?".  [...]

### Why it does make sense to unit test cookbooks?
From [Seth Vargo's blog](https://sethvargo.com/unit-testing-chef-cookbooks/):
>Answer: regression. If you tell Chef to install a package, it will install a package... But what if you don't? Or, what if you accidentally change the way a file is written out during a refactor? That's what your unit tests will catch!

Aside from regression, unit testing is essential when working with custom resource / LWRP to verify those work as expected.

Another reason is to test code branches (ifs / switches) if they behave as expected.

### RSpec
Behavior Driven Development for Ruby.

RSpec is testing framework for testing ruby. It provides such building blocks as `context`, `describe`, `it` as well lots of [built in matchers](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/built-in-matchers).

Example of rspec tests
```ruby
require 'rspec'

describe 'simple test' do
    it 'sums two numbers' do
       expect(2+3).to eq 5
    end
end
```

### Chefspec
From [chef docs](https://docs.chef.io/chefspec.html)
>ChefSpec is a framework that tests resources and recipes as part of a simulated chef-client run. ChefSpec tests execute very quickly. When used as part of the cookbook authoring workflow, ChefSpec tests are often the first indicator of problems that may exist within a cookbook.


To do:
* chefspec vs rspec
* solo runner vs server runner
* mocking out data bags
* mocking node attributes
* testing custom resources
